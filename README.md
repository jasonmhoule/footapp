# Fantasy Football Auction Dashboard

This Shiny dashboard offers decision support for competing in a fantasy football auction draft, including helpful display of information and real-time lineup optimization to calculate "bid-up-to" values. Helper functions allow a user to configure and load fantasy football auction draft data using a variety of league parameters.

## Getting Started

This repo comes bundled with an [RStudio project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects), which will be the easiest way to deploy the app and its data.

Much more to come on how to set up and use this app.
